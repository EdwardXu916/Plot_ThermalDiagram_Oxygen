# Plot_ThermalDiagram_Oxygen
Plot the p-h diagram, t-s diagram, and p-v diagram of oxygen.

As an introduction to the problem of constructing a chart or table of the thermodynamic properties of a real fluid, develop a thermodynamic properties chart for oxygen over the temperature range of − 100◦C to +150◦C and a pressure range of 1 to 100 bar. 

For simplicity we will assume oxygen obeys the Peng-Robinson equation of state and has an ideal gas heat capacity.
